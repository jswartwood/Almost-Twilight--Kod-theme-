This is meant as a rough port of the Twilight theme for the Kod editor.  Any improvements are welcome; there isn't much documentation on syntax styling in Kod.

To install:
mkdir ~/.kod
mkdir ~/.kod/styles
cp almost_twilight.css ~/.kod/styles/
defaults write se.hunch.kod style/url "~/.kod/styles/almost_twilight.css"

Enjoy.
